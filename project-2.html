				 <h2>Happy Valet Parking Brand Building</h2>
				 <div class="listing">
					<p>I was hired to build the graphic branding elements for a startup valet parking service. I worked directly with the CEO to formulate a style that would satisfy his vision for the company while adhering to modern design practices. He provided elements of the logo and overall branding scheme that he deemed necessary to include and I created a variety of drafts that incorporated this information.
					</p>
          <br>
         <h3>Logo Design</h3>
         <p>The logo design was completed first since this would be the main brand identifier. Through the logo, I developed a clean, sans-serif type style and a color scheme which included colors that are relevent to the locals that would be using this service.

        </figure
        <br>
        <p>Throughout the development of the logo, I made sure that it could be adjusted to fit a variety of situations throughout print and digital media. A horizontal version was developed, as well as a grayscale version and an all-white version to maintain high visiblity in placements with a dark background.

     <h3>Website Design</h3>
		 <p>The most important part of the brand development was building a responsive website that had good SEO rankings.
