				 <h2>Parkell Product Launch</h2>
				 <div class="listing">
					<p>Parkell developed an innovative dental material with bioactive technology. The product launch involved a multi-faceted approach through print and digital media, which required educating potential customers on the new bioactive advancements in addition to  providing promotional material.
					</p>
          <br>
         <h3>Print Media</h3>
         <p>The dental market was flooded with print materials for this launch. I worked on designing variety of magazine ads and two magazine covers that aided in widespread product recognition and increasing awareness of bioactive technology in the dental sphere.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The full page, full color print ads were featured in both U.S. publications and international publications. The product was officially announced in Germany at a trade show, so some ads were tailored to meet the needs of the German trade show publication. This launch was shaped to consider worldwide implications of the product and it successfully reached a worldwide audience.</p>

       <br>
       <p>The product is selling well on a global scale and it became necessary to design portable graphic displays for smaller trade shows. These displays, as well as Parkell's trade show booth, featured the premier launch graphics used in print publications to develop a sense of unity and recognition around the world.

      <br>
      <p>Additional marketing efforts were made in the United States, so I designed postcards for two mailer campaigns featuring product information and special introductory offers. These campaigns reached over 140,000 dental professionals throughout the country.

     <h3>Digital Media</h3>
		 <p>After I put together an analysis of traction received from previous Google Ad campaigns and synthesized that information with research on the competition, I wrote a collection of Google Ads for Predicta. I put together a collection of 20+ keywords that would capture potential leads and would be visible when customers searched for competing products. I designed and integrated a new landing page into the main Parkell website, which was where ad-clickers would be directed. This landing page contained an informative video and more in-depth information on the product. An "Order Now" button was included for viewers who were ready to make a purchase. My philosophy behind this landing page was to educate a potential buyer before trying to make a sale. The audience for this product generally expresses concerns over switching to new products, so trying to make a sale without allowing them time to understand the benefits of the product would not have been an effective approach. This landing page gave them visual and textual media to help comprehend the new material, and it did not make them feel rushed into having to buy something.

		<p>The digital approach to this launch also utilized multiple web banner ads and email campaigns. I designed static and dynamic graphics using infinitely looping GIFs and coded fully responsive HTML emails.
