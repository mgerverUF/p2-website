				 <h2>Parkell Product Launch</h2>
				 <div class="listing">
					<p>Parkell developed an innovative dental material with bioactive technology. The product launch involved a multi-faceted approach through print and digital media, which required educating potential customers on the new bioactive advancements in addition to  providing promotional material.
					</p>
          <br>
         <h3>Print Media</h3>
         <p>The dental market was flooded with print materials for this launch. I worked on designing variety of magazine ads and two magazine covers that aided in widespread product recognition and increasing awareness of bioactive technology in the dental sphere.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The full page, full color print ads were featured in both U.S. publications and international publications. The product was officially announced in Germany at a trade show, so some ads were tailored to meet the needs of the German trade show publication. This launch was shaped to consider worldwide implications of the product and it successfully reached a worldwide audience.</p>

       <br>
       <p>The product is selling well on a global scale and it became necessary to design portable graphic displays for smaller trade shows. These displays, as well as Parkell's trade show booth, featured the premier launch graphics used in print publications to develop a sense of unity and recognition around the world.

      <p>Additional marketing efforts were made in the United States, so I designed postcards for two mailer campaigns featuring product information and special introductory offers. These campaigns reached over 140,000 dental professionals throughout the country.

     <p>My approach to this launch was graphic consistency in order to establish a unified promotional strategy across all types of media.
